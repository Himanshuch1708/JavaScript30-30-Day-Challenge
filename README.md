# JavaScript30 30-Day Challenge

Welcome to the JavaScript30 30-Day Challenge repository! This repository contains the code and solutions for the challenges presented in the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos.

## What is JavaScript30?

JavaScript30 is a free online course created by Wes Bos that helps you improve your JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects in 30 days. Each project focuses on a different aspect of JavaScript and aims to provide practical coding experience.

This repository serves as a reference for the code and solutions provided in the course. It is organized into separate folders, each corresponding to a different day of the challenge.

## Getting Started

To get started with the JavaScript30 30-Day Challenge, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshuch1708/JavaScript30-30-Day-Challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's folder that you want to explore. For example, for Day 1, navigate to the `01 - JavaScript Drum Kit` folder.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

4. Read through the code and experiment with it. You can modify the existing code or add your own enhancements to understand the concepts better.

5. If you want to watch the course videos for a particular project, visit the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) website and sign up for the course.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the other projects as well, completing one project per day for 30 days.
